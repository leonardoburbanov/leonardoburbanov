### 📌 Tech Lead Skills  
Here are some of the key abilities I bring as a Tech Lead in software development:

- **Technical Leadership & Architecture**: I define scalable, maintainable software architectures and guide technical strategy.  
- **Code Quality & Standards**: I establish best practices, code review workflows, CI/CD pipelines, technical-debt management.  
- **Mentoring & Team Growth**: I coach engineers, facilitate knowledge sharing, enable team ownership and growth.  
- **Project Delivery & Execution**: I break down features, estimate tasks, manage risks, align with business goals to deliver on time.  
- **Communication & Stakeholder Engagement**: I translate complex technical concepts into business language, manage expectations, and build alignment.  
- **Continuous Learning & Innovation**: I stay current with emerging technologies, encourage experimentation, and drive improvement.

### 🌱 What I’m Exploring Next  
- Robust LLMOps frameworks for multi-agent systems  
- Comprehensive observability & evaluation pipelines for AI agents  
- Cost-efficient retrieval + generation architectures (RAG + tool usage)  
- Scalability and engineering maturity for AI-driven products  

---

### ⚡ Fun Facts  
- I’ve automated my inbox—and built the workflow behind it.  
- I view every LangGraph node as a living software component, not just a “function”.  
- I believe every AI agent deserves a dashboard, metrics, logs & test suite.
